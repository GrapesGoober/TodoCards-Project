# To run this
### Installation
This project needs `python3` and `nodejs`. We also need some python libraries: `flask`, `flask-cors`, and `mysql`.
### Running
There are 3 main components: the database, the backend, and the frontend
- Database: MAMP MySql at port 3306 (this is the default port)
- Backend: Navigate to TodoCards-Backend with `cd TodoCards-BackEnd` then run python `python app.py` (or just click play)
  - This should have the localhost running at port 5000
- FrontEnd: Navigate to TodoCards-Frontend with `cd TodoCards-FrontEnd` then run node `npm run dev`
  - This should have the localhost running at port 5173
  - If there is import issue, run `npm install`
