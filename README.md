# Description:

A “to-do” app called “TodoCard”, where each to-do items are encapsulated as “cards” organized under “folders”. The basic ideas are as follows:
- The app can have any number of users, 
- where each user can have one or more folders, 
- where each folder can have zero or more cards.
- Each card has basic information, such as
  - Name, description, created date, deadline, etc
  - A “Label”, a simple string used to aid in searching.
    For example: we can search “Card that is “urgent” AND is “group project”.
